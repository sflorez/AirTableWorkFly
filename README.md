# AirTableWorkFly
WIP scripts for interacting with airtable api.

# Disclaimer: This is not an example of production ready code! I have been using these scripts to aid in tasks that require more fine grained control of airtable mechanisms.

## airTableApi.py is what I have been maintaining as a set of helper functions around the airtable sdk. Please don't add to that file unless we decide on some necessary helper functions.

- Feel free to create whatever scripts you might need using the helper functions and the airtable sdk.
- If you add some scripts you believe might be good examples of how to do certain tasks in airtable update the repo with those.
- If you have any questions reach out to me and I will be glad to answer them.
- requirements.txt should have all the libs necessary to run the scripts.

### happy coding! :)
